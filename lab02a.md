# Growth Mindset
The concept of a growth mindset is a popular topic lately, and I sometimes say to myself *“Self, you need to embrace the growth mindset. The growth mindset is cool.”*
#### What is a growth mindset?
A growth mindset believes that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort.

***The main difference between the statistic or fixed mindset and the growth mindset is the fixed is not able to get any effort to convert the difficulties to opportunities, while the growth mindset is a positive person who take the challenge in every and each difficulty to convert it into opportunity***

#### Reminders ####
- I’ve found that taking the time to assess what I’m doing is effective in keeping me on track at work.
- When I feel myself losing focus, I try to remember that short-term effort will likely result in long-term improvement of my abilities.
- A growth mindset opens me up to more creativity and possibility, and I discover I’m able to achieve more and set higher goals.
