How Websites are Created
All websites use HTML and CSS, but content management systems, blogging software, 
and e-commerce platforms often add a few more technologies into the mix.
1- When you connect to the web, you do so via an Internet Service Provider (ISP). 
You type a domain name or web address into your browser to visit a site.

2- Your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

3- DNS servers tell your browser how to find the website, they tell your computer 
the IP address associated with the requested domain name.

4- The unique number that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your 
browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested.the web server then 
sends the page you requested back to the browser.
The HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets — these are called HTML elements. 
Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag.
 (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.) 
Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.
Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.




HTML ELEMENTS

Grouping Text and Elements In a Block:
The < div > element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.


Information About Your Pages:


The < meta > element lives inside the < head > element and contains information about that web page.

Markup


1- ID ATTRIBUTE:

Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element 
from other elements on the page.<p id="value">

2 - Comments in HTML

If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user’s browser,
 you can add the text between these characters:

<!-- -->

 

Layout: 

Header and Footer

The < header > and < footer > elements can be used for: ●● The main header or 
footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.


Navigation

<nav>
</nav>



<!-- <figure> <figcaption> It can be used to contain any content that is referenced
 from the main flow of an article (not just images).-->


*Javascript


JavaScript can be used in browsers to make websites more interactive, interesting, and user-friendly. In HTML documents javascript can:

1- Access Content; for example:

Select the text inside all of the < hl > elements on a page.
Select any elements that have a class attribute with a value of note.
2- MODIFY CONTENT; for example:

Add a paragraph of text after the first < hl > element.
Change the value of class attributes to trigger new CSS rules for those elements.
3- Program rules or instructions the browser can follow

What is Script ?
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
