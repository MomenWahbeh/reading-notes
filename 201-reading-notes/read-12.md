Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them 
into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.


The great things about Chart.js are that it’s simple to use and really very flexible. 

the <canvas> element has only two attributes, width and height. These are both optional and can also be set using DOM properties.

When no width and height attributes are specified, the canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high.

Fallback content
The <canvas> element differs from an <img> tag in that, like for <video>, <audio>, or <picture> elements, it is easy to define some fallback content, 
to be displayed in older browsers not supporting it, like versions of Internet Explorer earlier than version 9 or textual browsers. 
You should always provide fallback content to be displayed by those browsers.

 </canvas> closing tag always required 

The canvas is initially blank. To display something, a script first needs to access the rendering context and draw on it. The <canvas>
 element has a method called getContext(), used to obtain the rendering context and its drawing functions.

using <canvas> you can (draw rectangles, draw paths, draw a triangle, making lines, move lines, draw text)
