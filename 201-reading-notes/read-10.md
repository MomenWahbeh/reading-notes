#Debugging
The process that involves finding errors and removing them from your program.

Before solving the error we have to know the root cause of that error. Errors can result from:

-Including language features or syntax that the scripting engine does not support within the script.

-Failing to correctly implement the intent of the program or some particular algorithm. This occurs when, 
although code is syntactically correct and does not generate any errors, it produces behavior or results other than those you intend.

-Including components that contain bugs themselves. In this case, the problem lies with a particular component, 
rather than with your script, which “glues” the components together.


Examples of Errors: 

-RangeError :
It is when developer trying to pass a value as an argument to a function that does not allow.

-ReferenceError
It is referring to a variable that isn’t defined

-SyntaxError
refer to mistakes made by a programmer that include the grammar of the Java language.

-TypeError
It is referring to error when an operation could not be performed .
